					<h2>Front End Engineer</h2>
					<h4>Netpulse<br />October 2011 - July 2014</h4>
					<p>When I first started at Netpulse, my role as Front End Engineer was to develop and expand the capabilities of our massively scalable JavaScript/C++ application. With my help, we increased our client base to include 7 of the 8 major fitness equipment manufacturers, providing a reliable and easily maintainable entertainment platform to help engage exercisers. I also worked closely with our OEM partners and other third parties to ensure the delivery of high quality products within tight deadlines</p>
					<p>Some of my accomplishments include moving all our clients to a single codebase, refactoring the iPod communication module to pass MFi certification, designing a JavaScript/Qt interface for controlling all our media players, and developing a digital TV player using the libVLC API.</p>

					<h2>Code-Foo Intern</h2>
					<h4>IGN Entertainment<br />July 2011 - August 2011</h4>
					<p>Studied various languages and techniques for both front and back end web development, while assisting the IGN engineering team in different tasks. I also helped the Tech Page team in designing the new IGN Tech Channel. Using IGNâ€™s Oyster Framework and coding primarily in PHP, HTML, and JavaScript, I created and stylized three new widgets, two of which are still being used today.</p>

					<h2>Programmer</h2>
					<h4>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill<br />August 2009 - May 2010</h4>
					<p>Assisted Dr. Kenneth Lohmann of the Biology Department in his research on sea turtles by developing software to record their navigational patterns. Using C++ and the Win32 API, I was responsible for designing the UI and coding the underlying layer which provided the user with the ability to record and save custom trials.</p>

					<h2>Research Assitant</h2>
					<h4>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill<br />August 2008 - May 2009</h4>
					<p>Employed by Professor Prasun Dewan to explore a possible implementation of his Distributed Reflection project. The goal was to develop an application that could reflect upon a remote object, and using only the primitive data types sent back to the client, reconstruct the object as it was on the remote machine. Using Java Web Services to perform the remote procedure calls and Glassfish as the application server, I attempted to realize this goal. Although unsuccessful, my research provided invaluable insight into the nature of the project.</p>
